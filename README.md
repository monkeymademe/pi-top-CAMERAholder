#pi-top CAMERA holder

If you are looking for a way to hold your camera within your pi-top laptop or CEED this is the right thing for you.

Simply print this template (make sure you print to 100% scale) and use the template to make a card version.

You can just stick the paper print to card and then cut it out. I recommend card has its stronger and wont collapse on the weight of the camera.

I have 3 files here.

studio3 : is the template file if you own a Silhouette plotter (Black line = Pen, Red line = Cut)
ai : illustrator file
pdf : printer friendly file (remember 100% scale)
